# DDoS Protection Objectives

## Implemented Objective

### 1. **Excessive traffic from a single IP or IP range**  
   The system successfully detects and mitigates suspicious amounts of traffic originating from a single IP address or range, helping prevent basic DDoS attacks.

---

## Remaining Objectives

### 2. **Traffic from users sharing a single behavioral profile**  
   Implement detection mechanisms for identifying floods of traffic from users that share similar behavioral profiles, such as:
   - Device type
   - Geolocation
   - Web browser version  
   This will help identify coordinated DDoS attacks involving large groups of similar devices.

### 3. **Unexplained surge in requests to a single page or endpoint**  
   Add analytics to detect sudden and unexplained increases in traffic to a specific page or endpoint of the web service. This includes tracking:
   - Abnormal spikes in access to certain pages or APIs.
   - Differentiating legitimate traffic spikes from potential DDoS attack vectors.

### 4. **Odd traffic patterns**  
   Implement a mechanism for identifying unusual traffic patterns, such as:
   - Repetitive spikes at odd hours of the day.
   - Traffic spikes that occur in a predictable or unnatural manner (e.g., sharp traffic increases every 10 minutes).
